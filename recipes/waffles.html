        <p>Waffles are typically prepared by combining flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.<br> 
            In a separate bowl, milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract are whisked together until well combined.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wet ingredients are then added to the dry ingredients, and the mixture is whisked until just combined, leaving some<br>
            lumps. This helps create a light and airy texture in the finished waffle.
